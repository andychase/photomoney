# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously.

## Email (Temporary)

Right now we're collecting email addresses of people interested in using the service.
We also collect ip addresses of people submitting the form to prevent abuse or spam.

This information is stored on private log files hosted on [heroku](heroku.com) and [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com).

We will use this information to send 1 email when we launch and then we will destroy all of the data.
If for some reason we do not launch we will not send an email and simply destroy all of the data.

## Website Tracking

Our policy on privacy is that we actively try and destroy data whenever we can, personally identifying or not.

When you visit our website your ip address and other information will be stored in log files. We use these
services which may track more than we do:

* Cloudflare
* Github-pages


## Service Tracking

Our security model is based around holding your information for as short of a time as possible.

When you use our service we process the request and then delete the data.

We don't track or keep on records:

- Phone Numbers
- Destination Bitcoin addresses
- Your internal Blockchain account information

## Law Enforcement

We are established in the United States of America and fall under their jurisdiction.
We are not a service designed to be used for illegal activity and as such aren't designed to
fight back against their aggressive policing policies.

Users should assume that at any moment:

* The USA government may require that we start tracking a specific user (this includes phone numbers,
  destination addresses, and access to their internal Blockchain account).

The USA can't force us to continue operating other than for the course of a specific investigation.
If we are asked to start recording all user data we will simply shut down.
