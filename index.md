  <p>Snapcoin is shutting down due to lack of interest, lack of funding, and in the interest of security.</p>
  
<p>I'm excited about the future of Bitcoin, but I'm not sure how to get around the cost of using sms/mms and how to provide Bitcoin services in a secure manner when you are just a startup.</p>
  
  <p>If you had fund in snapcoin, please email me and I can help you recover the funds (email in the "About section").</p>
  
<p>  Best wishes and happy Bitcoining! -Andy<p>
