  <p>Snapcoin is shutting down due to lack of interest, lack of funding, and lack of security.</p>
  
<p>I'm excited about the future of Bitcoin, but I don't think the way forward is through feature phone technology.  It's not easy getting around the cost of using sms/mms and find a way to provide Bitcoin services in a secure manner during the startup phase. To protect users' money and interests in the best way possible, I've decided to suspend the service.</p>
  
  <p>If you had fund in Snapcoin, please email me and I can help you recover the funds (email in the "About section").</p>
  
<p>Best wishes! -Andy<p>
